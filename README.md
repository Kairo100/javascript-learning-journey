# 🚀 JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome!  
This is my personal repo where I, **Kairo**, document my journey to becoming a JavaScript developer.  
Here I’ll collect **lessons, notes, and practical projects** as I grow from beginner ➝ advanced.

---

## 📚 Learning Path

I’m starting with the book:  
- [Eloquent JavaScript (3rd Edition, PDF)](https://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf) ✅ *Currently reading & practicing*

Next, I’ll continue with other resources like:  
- *You Don’t Know JS (Yet)* by Kyle Simpson (free on [GitHub](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS))  
- *Learning JavaScript Design Patterns* by Addy Osmani  

---

## 🛠️ Projects & Practice

Here I’ll add my practical exercises and projects, such as:  
- 🔹 Simple Calculator  
- 🔹 To-Do List App  
- 🔹 API Projects (e.g., Weather App, GitHub Finder)  
- 🔹 Many more fullstack projects 

Each project will live in its own folder with code + notes.

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a **solid foundation** in core JavaScript.  
- Practice through **real-world projects**.  
- Share my progress publicly to stay accountable and help others learning too.  
- Eventually, become a **skilled JavaScript developer** ready for bigger projects.
