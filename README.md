# 🚀 JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome!  
This is my personal repo where I, **Kairo**, document my journey to becoming a JavaScript developer.  
Here I’ll collect **lessons, notes, and practical projects** as I grow from beginner ➝ advanced.

---

## 📚 Learning Path

I’m starting with the book:  
- [Eloquent JavaScript (3rd Edition, PDF)](https://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf) ✅ *Currently reading & practicing*

Next, I’ll continue with other resources like:  
- *You Don’t Know JS (Yet)* by Kyle Simpson (free on [GitHub](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS))  
- *Learning JavaScript Design Patterns* by Addy Osmani  

To stay on track, I’m following my **[90-Day JavaScript Roadmap](resources/90-days-roadmap.md)**, where I’ve broken down each day into clear topics, coding lessons, and projects. ✅

## 🛠️ Projects & Practice

Here I’ll add my practical exercises and projects, such as:  
- 🔹 Simple Calculator  
- 🔹 To-Do List App  
- 🔹 API Projects (e.g., Weather App, GitHub Finder)  
- 🔹 Many more fullstack projects  

Each project will live in its own folder with code + notes.

This makes it easy for anyone to follow:  
- **notes/** → my learning notes from books & daily roadmap  
- **lessons/** → small coding practices  
- **projects/** → larger hands-on apps  
- **resources/** → roadmap, books, references  
- **experiments/** → testing ground for ideas

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a **solid foundation** in core JavaScript.  
- Practice through **real-world projects**.
